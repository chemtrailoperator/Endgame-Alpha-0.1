This plugin is designed for Endless Sky version 0.10.10 or later. This plugin was designed with reference to v0.10.10 and v0.10.12 and it is unknown how it will perform on earlier versions. 

This plugin allows you to serve in the Navy and earn the Navy licenses that are currently in-game and unobtainable, and it will also add general content and other things we thought would be nice in the game.

Make sure you create a game save at the start of the story, the storyline is currently incomplete and many worlds will become inaccesible permanently. 

   Currently completed:
   
      Navy license -v1.0
      
      Navy Cruiser license -v1.0
      
      Uniform system w/ ribbons for awards. -v1.0
      
      Start of a huge alpha war. -v1.0
      
      A few navy jobs such as patrols and escorts. -v1.0
      
      Icon images. -v1.1
      

Planned changes:

      Navy carrier license. 
      
      Alpha War completion
      
      Shipyard on Quaru (RIng of Power) where you can buy heliarch ships when you get the Heliarch License
      
      Shipyards where you can buy just the hulls of ships, no outfits. 

      Change to the Alpha fighting dynamic.

Make sure you create a game save at the start of the storyline, many features that isolate systems and add pirates are not removed by the storyline since it is incomplete.
